# ODIT: Online Nonparametric Anomaly Detection

Anomaly  detection  is  an  important  problem  with  various  applications,  such  as  cybersecurity, surveillance, quality  control,  fraud detection,  fault  detection,  and  health  care. Here, we present a non-parametric sequential anomaly detection algorithm which is computationally effecient and applicable to high dimensional datasets. This package provides the MATLAB and Python codes for two implementation:

* ODIT 1: Only Nominal Training Data available.
* ODIT 2: Nominal and Anomalous Training Data available.
